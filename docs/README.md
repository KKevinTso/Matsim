# Matsim&nbsp;&nbsp;![logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

> A sleek, intuitive interface for building Simulink models from a Matlab script.

## What is it

Matsim is a high level interface to create Simulink models from a [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) script. Matsim is a wrapper around the standard [simulink API](https://it.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/approach-modeling-programmatically.html) that makes building a simulink model programmatically much faster.

## Key features
* **Automatic layout** (no need to specify block positions!)
* **Intuitive interface** (you can "add", "subtract", "multiply", ... simulink blocks)
* **Extensible library** (easily add new blocks from your custom libraries)

## Quick start

Jump right in with the [installation guide](quickstart.md#install) and [examples](quickstart.md#examples)!
